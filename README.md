# App-Based Audiometer

App-Based Audiometer is a web application designed to measure hearing acuity. This project integrates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and MySQL to provide an intuitive user interface and seamless user experience. Additionally, it employs a Machine Learning (ML) model trained on open-source data to enhance the accuracy of hearing tests.

# App-Based Audiometer
- User-friendly interface for conducting hearing tests \
- Real-time data processing and result generation\
- Secure user authentication and data storage\
- Visualization of hearing test results\
- ML model integration for improved accuracy

# Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\
- Backend: Flask\
- Database: MySQL\
- Machine Learning: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)\
- Others: Jinja2 for templating

# Machine Learning Model
The ML model is trained using open-source data from "https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/data/datasets/sd-1001-2014-0/default.html"\
The model aims to enhance the accuracy of hearing tests by predicting hearing loss levels based on user inputs and test results.
